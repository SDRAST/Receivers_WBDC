\chapter{Introduction}\label{chap:intro}

\section{Hardware Overview}

A Wide-Band Down-Converter processes dual-polarization K-band signals from two
feed horns. There are two versions of the WBDC.
The feed switching, polarization selection, and down-conversion are basically 
the same in both WBDC designs.

WBDC1 has two dual-polarization RF sections, one for 22 and one for 24~GHz.
Two switch-selectable LOs determine which band is processed by the one IF section. 

WBDC2 has five dual-polarization RF sections and 20 IF 
sections (2 feeds $\times$ 2 polarizations $\times$ 5 bands).
The internals of WBDC2 are described in Subsection~\ref{sec:WBDC2}.

All functions are controlled by a motherboard
through LabJack\textsuperscript{\textregistered} general-purpose I/O 
interfaces.
The WBDC1 LabJacks are accessed through a USB hub by an external computer.  
WBDC2 LabJacks are controlled with a Raspberry Pi embedded computer accessed 
via ethernet.

\subsection{Input Switching}

The first stage of the WBDC allows the two dual-polarization down-converters to
be switched between the two feeds\index{switching!feeds}.  

\subsection{Polarization Conversion}

The four RF signals are split into two bands (22 and 24) in WBDC1 and five bands
in WBDC2.\index{bands!frequency}  After the band-selecting 
RF filters, the linearly polarized signals from each
feed can be switched into a quadrature hybrid\index{hybrid!polarization}  to be
converted to circular
polarization.  This is discussed further in Appendix~\ref{app:pol} 
PIN diode attenuators\index{attenuator!PIN diode} are provided  to balance the 
signals into
these hybrids.

\subsection{Sideband Separation}

In the closed modules on the far right are the down-converters, which have 
complex mixers putting out two IFs\index{down-convertor}
from 0 to 1000~MHz, with a 90$^{\circ}$ phase difference.
Both IFs go from -1000~MHz to +1000~MHz but the negative and positive
frequencies are mixed together.
These may be considered the real and imaginary components of
a complex signal.\index{hybrid!sideband separating}
There are switches which can direct each I/Q pair into a quadrature
hybrid to convert them to an upper and lower sideband pair.

\section{Monitor and Control}

Monitor and control is done with two or three\index{LabJack} 
LabJack\textsuperscript{\textregistered} general purpose I/O devices. 

\subsection{LabJack 1}

This LabJack with local ID 1 (on the center left of the motherboard) controls 
the WBDC motherboard.   The motherboard has groups of\index{latch group}
eight latches which are used to control and sense switches, and to select
analog monitoring points.  The LabJack's ADC channels read currents, voltages, 
and temperatures. 

\subsection{Labjack 2 (and 3)}

LabJack 2 (and 3 for WBDC2), on the box walls at the ends of the row of 
filters, control PIN diode attenuators\index{attenuator!PIN diode}.
There are four voltage-controlled RF attenuators (PIN diodes) for each
down-converter sub-band.  The voltages are generated in LabJack
TickDACs attached to the terminals of LabJack 2 (and 3 for WBDC2).


\chapter{Command Line}\label{chap:cmd-line}

The program {\tt wbdc2\_prompt.py}\footnote{In
{\scriptsize \tt /usr/local/lib/python2.7/DSN-Sci-packages/MonitorControl/Receivers/WBDC/apps}.}
provides the user with a direct Python command line interface in a terminal 
session on the embedded Raspberry Pi. This command line has access to all
the equipment in the specified configuration\index{configuration}.
It simply configures the hardware and 
software as described in Chapter~\ref{chap:config}.

To command the receiver only, the commands are simply\footnote{This example uses
{\tt ipython}, a powerful Python command line interface, described in 
Appendix~\ref{Python}.}
\begin{code}[h!tb]
\begin{center}
\begin{verbatim}
  
In [1]: from MonitorControl.Receivers.WBDC.WBDC2.WBDC2hwif import WBDC2hwif
In [2]: receiver = WBDC2hwif("WBDC-2")\end{verbatim}
\caption{\label{code:ipython}Ipython example of creating a receiver object from
a {\tt WBDC2hwif} class.}
\end{center}
\end{code}

The programming style used is ``object oriented'',\index{object oriented} 
so that a command takes the 
form {\tt object.method()} where {\tt object} is an ``instance'' of a ``class'.
In this implementation, classes may have private classes. Think of systems and 
subsystems, so that a command can also have the form
{\tt parent.child.method()}. Classes can also have instances of other public
classes as ``attributes'', which leads to the same command structure.
In the program {\tt wbdc2\_prompt.py}, {\tt receiver} is an instance of the
{\tt WBDC2} class.

The Python {\tt help()} command can be very useful at the command line.  It can
be invoked at any level of the hierarchy.  These examples 
\begin{verbatim}
  help(receiver)
  help(receiver.get_crossover)
  help(receiver.crossSwitch)
  help(receiver.crossSwitch.get_state)\end{verbatim}
will become clearer below.

\section{High-level Commands}

At the moment the commands described here are only implemented for 
{\tt WBDC\_prompt}.  When using a {\tt WBDC2hwif} instance, mid-level and
low-level commands must be used.

\subsection{Feed Switch Control}\label{subsec:feed_switch}

The WBDC class of receivers have two feed horns with two linear polarizations,
``E'' and ``H''.  There are four input channels called ``F1E'', ``F1H'',
``F2E'' and ``F2H''.  These feed a pair of switches through which the receivers
connect to the feeds.  In the default state (logic state 0),
``F1E''$\rightarrow$``R1E'' and ``F1H''$\rightarrow$``R1H''.  In the {\it set}
state (logic state 1), ``F1E''$\rightarrow$``R2E'' and 
``F1H''$\rightarrow$``R2H''.  The commands for this are shown in 
Snippet~\ref{code:crossover}.\index{switching!feeds}
\begin{code}[h!tb]
\begin{center}
  \begin{verbatim}
  
  receiver.get_crossover()
  receiver.set_crossover(crossover=False)\end{verbatim}
\caption{\label{code:crossover}Sensing and controlling the transfer switch.}
\end{center}
\end{code}
The keyword {\tt crossover} is not required in this case but is
mnemonically useful. The value {\tt True} sets the switch.

\subsection{Polarization Mode}

Each of the four receiver sections feeds five bandpass filters.
``Band 18'' goes from 17 to 19~GHz, ``Band 20'' from 19 to 21, and so on to
``Band 26'' from 25 to 27 GHz.  There are ten sections which can convert the
linearly polarized modes ``E'' and ``H'' produced by the front end to 
circularly polarized modes ``L'' and ``R''.\index{hybrid!polarization}  

The command for sensing and controlling the polarization mode are given in
Snippet~\ref{code:polsec}.
\begin{code}[h!tb]
\begin{center}
  \begin{verbatim}
  
  receiver.get_pol_modes()
  receiver.set_pol_modes(circular=False)\end{verbatim}
\caption{\label{code:polsec}Sensing and controlling the polarization mode.}
\end{center}
\end{code}
{\tt receiver.get\_pol\_modes()} returns a Python {\tt dict} (short for 
``dictionary'') which is a key:value  array with the states of all the 
polarization sections.  The command {\tt receiver.set\_pol\_modes()}
sets all the polarization sections in the entire receiver to the designated
state. The default state, that is, if {\tt set\_pol\_modes()} is invoked
without specifying an argument, is {\tt False}.  This command automatically 
invokes {\tt get\_pol\_modes()} as its last step.

\subsection{Down-conversion Mode}

The outputs from the polarization sections go into down-converters which have
names like ``DC['R1-18P1']'' (receiver 1, band 18, polarization 1) which 
reflects the fact that the polarization is
now ambiguous. ``P1'' can be ``E'' or ``L'' while ``P2'' can be ``H'' or ``R''
depending on the state of the polarization section providing the signal.

There are quadrature hybrids\index{hybrid!sideband separating} which may be 
used to convert the
in-phase and quad-phase IFs to lower sideband (-1000 to 0~MHz) and upper 
sideband (0 to 1000~MHz) IFs.  The default state (logic 0) of these sections is
L/U mode; the optional I/Q mode is logic state 1.  

The commands for sensing and controlling the down-converter section IF mode is
shown in Snippet~\ref{code:DCsec}.
\begin{code}[h!tb]
\begin{center}
  \begin{verbatim}
  
  receiver.get_IF_mode()
  set_IF_mode(SB_separated=False)\end{verbatim}
\caption{\label{code:DCsec}Sensing and controlling the down-converter mode.}
\end{center}
\end{code}
The first command
returns a Python {\tt dict} with the states of all the downconverters.
All the downconverters can be set to the same state with the command
{\tt set\_IF\_mode()}.
It also returns a Python {\tt dict} with the states of all the downconverters.

\subsection{Analog Monitoring}

The analog inputs to LabJack 1 are connected to various analog monitoring
points.
The power supply voltages, currents to various subsystems, temperatures at
three locations and the power levels into the RF sections can all be monitored.

Analog inputs 0 and 1 return currents and voltages respectively. AIN2 and AIN3 
return RF power and temperature. The address of the current and voltage monitor
point is sent to latchgroup 1 at address 0.  The address of the RF power and
temperature is sent to latchgroup 1 at address 2.

The command {\tt receiver.readAnalogs(latchAddress)} returns a Python dict with
all the analog data available through that latch group.

\subsection{Other}

For completeness we note here one other high-level command which can be useful
for debugging the equipment.
\begin{verbatim}
  receiver.check_IO_config()
\end{verbatim}
reports on the configuration of the WBDC2's three LabJack multi-purpose I/O
devices. Section~\ref{sec:cfg_chk} shows a typical output and the proper
configuration of the LabJacks.


\section{Mid-level Commands}

These commands which can be used with the receiver sub-systems.

\subsection{Feed Switch Control}

The crossover switch subsystem can be addressed directly.
\index{switching!feeds}
The commands to check and set the state of the cross-over switch are shown in
Snippet~\ref{code:Xswitch}.
\begin{code}[h!tb]
\begin{center}
  \begin{verbatim}

  receiver.crossSwitch.get_state()
  receiver.crossSwitch.set_state(True)\end{verbatim}
  \caption{\label{code:Xswitch}Sensing and controlling the crossover switch
directly.}
\end{center}
\end{code}
These have the same effect as the commands shown in 
Snippet~\ref{code:crossover}.


It can happen that the two switches are not in the same state.  Then
{\tt get\_crossover()} will give an error message.  The state of the individual
switches can be queried with the commands in Snippet~\ref{code:xswitch}.
\begin{code}[h!tb]
\begin{center}
  \begin{verbatim}
  
  receiver.crossSwitch['E'].get_state()
  receiver.crossSwitch['H'].get_state()\end{verbatim}
  \caption{\label{code:xswitch}Sensing the state of the individual crossover
  switches.}
\end{center}
\end{code}
The switches can be set individually with similar {\tt set\_state()} commands.

\subsection{Polarization Mode}

The state of the individual polarization sections can be queried and set with
the commands in Snippet~\ref{code:pol_sec}.\index{hybrid!polarization}
\begin{code}[h!tb]
\begin{center}
\begin{verbatim}

  receiver.pol_sec['R120'].get_state()
  receiver.pol_sec['R120'].set_state(True)
  receiver.pol_sec['R1-18'].atten['H'].set_atten(10)\end{verbatim}
  \caption[Control of individual polarization sections]
  {\label{code:pol_sec}Commands
  to sense and set the mode of individual
  polarization sections and to balance their inputs.}
\end{center}
\end{code}  
The {\it set} state (logic level 1) means that the conversion is made.  The
default state is {\tt False} (logic level 0).
For the polarization sections to function properly, the two incoming signals
must be balanced.  For that purpose, each polarization section has two
attenuators which can be adjusted.\index{attenuator!PIN diode} 
(The balancing procedure is described elsewhere.)
The attenuation can be queried with a corresponding {\tt get\_atten()}
command but it does not read the hardware.  It only reports what the last
{\tt set\_atten()} command did.  The attenuation specified is relative to
the minimum attenuation of the attenuator, which is in the range of 7 to 9~dB.

The state of a single down-converter hybrid can be queried and set
with commands like those in 
Snippet~\ref{code:IQhybrids}.\index{hybrid!sideband separating}
\begin{code}[h!tb]
\begin{center}
\begin{verbatim}

  receiver.DC['R1-18P1'].get_state()
  receiver.DC['R1-18P1'].set_state(True)\end{verbatim}
\caption{\label{code:IQhybrids}Commands for sensing and setting a 
down-converter I/Q hybrid.}
\end{center}
\end{code}



\section{Low Level Commands}

\subsection{LabJacks}

At the heart of the monitor and control subsystem are two (or three) 
LabJacks.  (They can also provide other functions, like timers,
which we don't use.)\index{LabJack}

There are eight I/O lines available at screw terminals on the unit. These can
all function as digital inputs or outputs, or analog inputs, according to the
value of some configuration bytes.  They are called FIO0-FIO7 when functioning
as digital ports and AIN0-AIN7 when functioning as analog ports.  In addition,
the DB25 connector on the LabJacks provides an additional 12 digital IO lines,
called EIO0-EIO7 and CIO0-CIO3.  Each LabJack also has two analog
outputs called DAC0 and DAC1, which we don't use.

Communication with the LabJack consists mainly of reading and writing bytes to
the FIO, DIO and CIO groups.


\subsection{Digital Monitor and Control}

All the switches described above are controlled by latches.  The latches are
logically grouped, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:latches}, with up to eight
latches per group.\index{latch group}
\begin{table}[h!tb]
  \begin{center}
    \caption{\label{tab:latches}Latch Groups for Digital Monitor and Control}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|l|}
      \hline
      {\bf Latch Group} & {\bf Function} \\
      \hline
      X & controls the cross-over switches \\
      R1P & controls the receiver 1 polarization sections \\
      R2P & controls the receiver 1 polarization sections \\
      PLL & monitors the cross-over switch state and LO phase lock \\
      R1I1 & receiver 1 IF group 1 (bands 18 and 20) \\
      R1I2 & receiver 1 IF group 2 (bands 22, 24 and 26) \\
      R2I1 & receiver 2 IF group 1 (bands 18 and 20) \\
      R2I2 & receiver 2 IF group 2 (bands 22, 24 and 26) \\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}
Latch groups are read as bytes, as shown by the examples in 
Snippet~\ref{code:LGm&c}.
\begin{code}[h!tb]
\begin{center}
\begin{verbatim}

  In [7]: Math.decimal_to_binary(receiver.lg['P2I2'].read())
  Out[7]: '00000000'
  In [12]: Math.decimal_to_binary(receiver.lg['PLL'].read())
  Out[12]: '01110100'
\end{verbatim}
\caption{\label{code:LGm&c}Setting a latch group.}
\end{center}
\end{code}
The bit assignment for each latch group is described in
Subsection~\ref{subsec:DM1}.  There is a
corresponding {\tt write()} command which could be used in this way
\begin{verbatim}
  receiver.lg['X'].write(int('00000011',2))
\end{verbatim}
to set the cross-over switches.

Setting an individual latch involves
\begin{enumerate}\itemsep0pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
  \item reading the byte from the latch group of interest,
  \item changing the desired bit, and
  \item writing the modified byte to the latch group.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Attenuator Control}

The attenuators are PIN diodes\index{attenuator!PIN diode}
controlled with a voltage (or more strictly, the current resulting from an
applied voltage).  The voltages are supplied by dual-channel (``A'' and
``B'') digital-to-analog converters.  The DACs are connected to a LabJack
multi-function IO interface.

In the example in Snippet~\ref{code:DAC}
an instance of a DAC is created and the A side is set to -2~V.
\begin{code}[h!tb]
\begin{center}
\begin{verbatim}

  from Electronics.Interfaces.LabJack import LJTickDAC
  
  LJTickDAC(receiver.LJ[2],'R1-18')['A'].setVoltage(-2)
  
  vs = LJTickDAC(receiver.LJ[2],'R1-18')['A']
  vs.setVoltage(-2)\end{verbatim}
\caption{\label{code:DAC}Two ways of instantiating and setting a DAC.}  
\end{center}
\end{code}
The first way avoids creating an enduring instance of the DAC.  However, it is
pretty cumbersome so the second way, which creates an instance of a DAC,
although taking two steps, is usually preferred.  And there might be need to
use {\tt vs} again.

The LJTickDAC is an ``attribute'' of the polarization section and so also be 
addressed as {\tt receiver.pol\_sec['R1-18'].tdac['A']}.

Using this command to control the attenuation requires knowledge of the 
attenuation {\it vs} control voltage curve.  This is discussed elsewhere.


\chapter{Monitor and Control System}\label{chap:MandC}

\section{Motherboard Control}

Motherboard\index{motherboard} signals are monitored and controlled with 
digital latches (logical devices which preserve a specified logic state). 
The latches are connected to\index{latch group}
serial-in/parallel-out registers.  These registers are addressed using the EIO
out bits of LabJack 1.  The data are then clocked into the register using
the SDI and SCK signals.  Table~\ref{tab:signals} shows how the LabJack ports 
are used to control the motherboard signals.
\begin{table}[h!tb]
  \begin{center}
    \caption{\label{tab:signals}Motherboard Signals and LabJack Ports}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|r|l|l|}
    \hline
    \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\bf Labjack} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{\bf WBDC Motherboard} \\
    \hline
     {\bf Name} & {\bf Channel} & {\bf Name}  & {\bf Function} \\
    \hline
      AIN0  &   0    & IMON &  Analog input measuring supply currents \\
      AIN1  &   1    & VMON &  Analog Input measuring supply voltages \\

   \hline
      EI00  &   8    & A0   &      Latch address LSB \\
      EI01  &   9    & A1   &      .. \\
      EI02  &  10    & A2   &      .. \\
      EI03  &  11    & A3   &      .. \\
      EI04  &  12    & A4   &      .. \\
      EI05  &  13    & A5   &      .. \\
      EI06  &  14    & A6   &      .. \\
      EI07  &  15    & A7   &      Latch address MSB \\
    \hline
      CI00  &  16    & SCK     &   Serial Clock input \\
      CI01  &  17    & SDI     &   Data input \\
      CI02  &  18    & NLOAD   &   Load data to/from latches \\
      CI03  &  19    & CS-BUS  &   Eable writing to or reading from latch \\
    \hline  
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}
The state of NLOAD is normallly high. When checking status (or reading bits),
NLOAD is toggled low for at least 10 mS then high to store the information for
reading.
CS-BUS is the global enable. The normal state is high. This is set to low when
programming latches or reading data. It is set high when done.

LabJack 1 is capable of addressing 256 latches on a WBDC motherboard.
They are grouped in 32 sets of 8 latches. The first four of the latch groups,
at addresses 0--3, 8--11, 16--19, ..., 80--83, ..., 248--251,
are writing to control bits. The second four of the latch group,
at addresses 4--7, 12--15, 20--23, ...,84--87, ..., 252--255,
are for reading from control or status bits ({\it e.g.} switch position 
indicators).

Latch group address bits A0-A7 (ports EIO0--EIO7 on LabJack 1) are used to 
address a specific 8-bit latch group for writing or reading. The latch data are
bytes sent or read serially, MSB first.  The latch group address encoded with 
the EIO bits consists of three parts:
\begin{description}\itemsep0pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
  \item[EIO7-EIO3]  encodes the motherboard digital module (DM = 1, 2, or 3) 
  address.
  \item[EIO2] indicates write if 0 and read if 1.
  \item[EIO1-EIO0] along with EIO2, selects the latch group (LG = 1-4) in a 
  digital  module.
\end{description}
So latches in write-mode have addresses ending in 0--3.  Latches in read-mode
have addresses ending in 4--7. 

The DM 1 bit address assignment differs for 
WBDC1 and WBDC2. DM~1 LG~1 has a EIO value (address) of 80 (0101~0000) in WBDC1
and 8 (0000~1000) in WBDC2. LG~2 in any DM has EIO0=1.   WBDC2 DM~2 LG~1 has 
address 16 (0001~0000).



\subsection{Digital Module 1}\label{subsec:DM1}

Seven latch groups are assigned to digital monitoring, that is, the program
reads the latch states.\index{digital module}

\subsubsection{Feed Crossover Switch}

The feed crossover switches\index{switching!feeds} are controlled with DM~1 
LG~1 using bits L1A0 and
L1A1 (A0, A1 on latchgroup 1): logic~0 for through and logic~1 for 
crossed. The commanded state can be read at the same bits (A0, A1 at LG address
12). However, the actual states of the cross-over switches are read at L4A0 and
L4A1 (LG 3).

\subsubsection{Polarization Hybrids}

\paragraph{WBDC1} (to be provided).

\paragraph{WBDC2} receiver chain~1 polarization hybrids are controlled by
latchgroups 2 and 3. 
The receiver chain~1 polarization hybrids are controlled by L2A0--L2A4.
The receiver chain~2 polarization hybrids are controlled by L3A0--L3A4.
\begin{verbatim}
  Band  Control Bits
   18    L2A0 L3A0
   20    L2A1 L3A1
   22    L2A2 L3A2
   24    L2A3 L3A3
   26    L2A4 L3A4
 \end{verbatim}
 Logic level~0 is for bypassing the hybrids, that is, linear polarization.
Logic level~1 is for converting linear to circular, that is, X and Y
polarization to L and R.


\subsubsection{Local Oscillator Lock}

Latch Group 4 monitors the state of the transfer switches and the local 
oscillator phase-locked loops
\begin{verbatim}
  Pol   Status Bit
    X      L4A0
    Y      L4A1
  Band  Status Bit
   18      L4A2
   20      L4A3
   22      L4A4
   24      L4A5
   26      L4A6 
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Latch LEDs}

The monitor bits should match the LEDs in the respective digital module.
In WBDC1 the DM is to the top right
With the hinge of the lid at the bottom, the LabJacks are upside down. 
The LEDs are in LSB -> MSB order and grouped as
\begin{verbatim}
LG 3 address 82 or 86    LG 4 address 83 or 87
LG 1 address 80 or 84    LG 2 address 81 or 85
\end{verbatim}
If the box is mounted on a wall or ceiling and the lid is hanging down,
the order is more conventional.

In WBDC2 there are three DMs at the top left of the lids, numbered from left
to right.  DM~3 is a spare. The (upside down) LED ordering is
\begin{verbatim}
LG addr 10 or 14   LG addr 11 or 15         LG addr 18 or 22   LG addr 19 or 23
LG addr  8 or 12   LG addr  9 or 13         LG addr 16 or 20   LG addr 17 or 21
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Digital Module 2}\label{sec:DM2}

This only applies to WBDC2.  Four latch groups are used to control the I/Q
hybrids.
Receiver chain 1 I/Q hybrids are controlled by latch groups 1 and~2 (low 
address). Receiver chain 2 I/Q hybrids are controlled by latch groups 3 and~4
(low address).
The two bypass switches for each hybrid are controlled with one bit.
Logic level 1 is for IQ; logic level 0 is for LU.
This is the bit assigment:
\begin{verbatim}
          Rec 1        Rec 2
  Band  Pol1  Pol2   Pol1  Pol2
   18   L1A0  L1A1   L3A0  L3A1
   20   L1A2  L1A3   L3A2  L3A3
   22   L2A0  L2A1   L4A0  L4A1
   24   L2A2  L2A3   L4A1  L4A2
   26   L2A4  L2A5   L4A3  L4A4
\end{verbatim}
   
\subsection{WBDC1 Analog Monitoring}

Latch addresses 0 and 2 address the\index{analog data}
registers used to select analog monitoring points.
bit pattern sent to latch address 0 selects a current and a voltage
to be connected to AIN0 and AIN1.  A bit pattern sent to latch address
2 selects a thermistor to be connected to AIN2.  AIN3 is not used in this
receiver.

(Register addresses to be provided.)

\subsection{WBDC2 Analog Monitoring}

\subsubsection{Latch 1 (Address 0)}

This latch addresses the register used to select voltage and current monitoring
points.  Voltage points are
selected using bits 0-2 and read at AIN1.  Currents are selected using bits
3-6 and read at AIN0.  The addresses can be ANDed to select any voltage point
with any current point.  

The monitor point address bits for voltage are shown in Table~\ref{tab:volt-mon}. 
The actual voltages are the byte read times the scale factor shown in 
Table~\ref{tab:volt-mon}
\begin{table}[h!tb]

\hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

The monitor point addresses for currents are shown in 
Table~\ref{tab:I-mon-points}.
The actual currents are the value read offset by -0.026.

  \end{center}
\end{table}


\subsubsection{Latch 2 (Address 1)}

This latch selects temperature monitor point with bits 0--2 to be read at AIN3
and RF detector voltages with bits 3--6 to be read at AIN2.
Table~\ref{tab:T-mon-points} gives the monitor address bits for temperature.
\begin{table}[h!tb]

1 & {\tt xxxxx010} & AIN3 & & BE plate     \\
 \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}
The conversion from measured volts to temperature is
\begin{displaymath}
  T = (V_{AIN3}+0.2389275)*23.549481

\end{table}\footnote{The bit patterns for the detectors still need to be
verified.}
The actual reading is (data-0.004)*2.0064.

\chapter{Configurations}\label{chap:config}

A WBDC is one element of a receiving system, specifically a {\tt Receiver}.  
The\index{configuration}
receiver obtains its signals from a front end and delivers signals to a 
backend.  A configuration is a description of the signal flow from the point
where the antenna focuses radiation on a feed to the point where data are
processed by a computer.  At the very minimum, a receiver must know something
about where its signal comes from and what properties were imposed by the
preceding equipment.

Configurations are stored in the {\tt DSN-Sci-packages} directory under\linebreak
{\tt MonitorControl/Configurations}.  The configuration used by the 
program {\tt wbdc2\_prompt.py} is shown in Snippet~\ref{code:config}.

\caption[Configuration used by {\tt wbdc2\_prompt.py}]{\label{code:config}
Configuration description used by the program
{\tt wbdc2\_prompt.py} to test WBDC2 in the lab.}
\end{center}
\end{code}
This shows that the {\tt Receiver} is a class {\tt WBDC2} device with the name
``WBDC2''.  It has four inputs named ``F1E'', ``F1H'', ``F2E'' and
``F2H'' which were introduced in Subsection~\ref{subsec:feed_switch}. They
obtain their signals from front end outputs with the same names.  They
don't have to be the same but it was natural in this case.  In general, port
names can be the label for the port on the device.

In this case the description stops at the WBDC.  However, a phantom 
{\tt FrontEnd} object (one that can't be controlled or monitored) had to be 
defined because the {\tt Receiver} expects a signal source.  The 
{\tt FrontEnd} needs a {\tt Telescope} for a signal.

The {\tt Observatory} provides a context for the {\tt Telescope}.  There are
devices which depend on the observatory, rather than a particular telescope.
The {\tt Telescope} object has one output which provides the signal to one or
more input ports of the {\tt FrontEnd}.  The {\tt Observatory} object has
information not specific to a {\tt Telescope}, such as weather data.

The above configuration description does not yet contain any back-ends, since
no back-end servers have yet been implemented at CDSCC.  However, the
distribution of IF signals from WBDC2 to down-stream devives has been
implemented through a manually controlled patch panel.  The description of the
patching is maintained in a spreadsheet, which can be interrogated this way:
\begin{code}[h!tb]
  \begin{center}
  \begin{verbatim}

\end{center}
\end{code}

\chapter{Servers and Clients}\label{chap:servers}

The entire system described in the previous chapter is operated through a
collection of servers. Our goal is to have each device controlled by a servers
and to control the entire system through a top server which controls all the
others.  The top server should ``know'' the state of the entire system at all
times.

All servers and clients communicate using the Pyro package.  This package must
also be installed on any client.  A local object which provides the remote
server functionality is obtained with this function:
\begin{verbatim}
In [2]: from support.pyro import get_device_server
\end{verbatim}

\section{K-band System Server}

Although all the equipment servers described in the following sections can be
used independently, there is an overall system server which is a client of the
equipment servers.  The intent, not yet implemented for DSS-43 K2, is that the
server ``knows'' the complete state of the system.  For example, it knows the
source of the signal entering SAO spectrometer 0 (ROACH 1).

The name by which it is known to the Pyro nameserver is 
{\ttfamily K2\_Server-crux}.  What really identifies it is {\ttfamily K2\_Server}
with {\ttfamily -crux} indicating the host on which it is running.  In
retrospect, this is inconsistent with the design of Pyro, which is that the
client should not need to know where the server is running.  So this will be
changed.

For historical reasons the code for this server is in 
{\ttfamily crux:/home/ops/SpecCtrl}.  Emulation of the K1 monitor and control
is, for compatibility with {\ttfamily observatoryCtrl}, provided by the K1 
{\ttfamily set\_WBDC} command.  The recognized options are shown in 
Table~\ref{tab:WBDCoptions}.
\begin{table}[h!tb]
 \begin{center}
  \caption{\label{tab:WBDCoptions}{\ttfamily set\_WBDC} Options}

invoked by the clients.  Commands which are already implemented are
\begin{description}\itemsep0pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
\item[report\_WBDC\_state()] (FE, WBDC) Returns a report with the time, the load 
positions, the cross-switch state, the states of the polarization hybrids, and
the states of the IF hybrids. (It also returns dummy valaues for the K1 band
switch and the local oscillator lock.)
\item[set\_atten(atten\_id, value)] (WBDC) Set PIN diode attenuator for IF
channel.
\item[set\_atten\_defaults()] (WBDC) Sets all four attenuators to 5 dB.
\item[get\_atten(atten\_id)] (WBDC) Get PIN diode attenuator for IF channel
\item[init\_pms()] (FE) Initializes the Hewlett Packard (Agilent) power meters
\item[set\_pm\_mode(atten\_id, mode)] (FE) Sets the modes of the Hewlett Packard 
(Agilent) power meters
\item[read\_pms()] (FE) Read power meters. The power meters are read in the
order 1, 2, 3, 4.  The corresponding receiver outputs are specified by private
method {\ttfamily \_pm\_sources()}.
\end{description}
The subsystems involved are shown in parentheses.

\section{WBDC1 Server}

To be added later when WBDC1 is adapted for use at Goldstone.

\section{WBDC2 Server}

A local object corresponding to the remote WBDC2 controller is obtained this
way:
\begin{verbatim}
In [3]: wbdc = get_device_server("wbdc2hw_server-dss43wbdc2","crux")
\end{verbatim}
{\ttfamily wbdc2hw\_server-dss43wbdc2} is the host name of the Raspberry Pi
inside WBDC2.  {\ttfamily crux} is the host running the Pyro server.

See the previous section for commands that are currently available through the
K2 server.
           

\subsection{Examples}

These are examples of how to monitor and control the receiver through its
server.  Note that {\ttfamily WBDC2hw\_server} is a subclass of
{\ttfamily WBDC2hwif} so some of the commands below are redundant but
convenient.

\subsubsection{Crossover Switch}

{\ttfamily False} or state 0 indicates that receiver 1 gets its signals from
feed 1 and likewise for 2.  {\ttfamily True} or state 1 means that receiver
1 is connected to feed 2 and {\itshape vice versa}.
\begin{verbatim}
In [4]: wbdc.get_crossover()
Out[4]: False
In [6]: wbdc.set_crossover(True)
Out[6]: True
In [7]: wbdc.set_crossover(False)
Out[7]: False\end{verbatim}
The corresponding {\ttfamily WBDC2hwif} command, which can also be used,
is {\ttfamily get\_Xswitch\_state()}.

\subsubsection{Polarization Sections}

A polarization section state is 0 if it passes the native E/H polarizations to
the down-converter sections, and 1 if it converts then to L/R.
\begin{verbatim}
In [6]: wbdc.get_polarizers()
Out[6]:
  {'R1-18': 0, 'R1-20': 0, 'R1-22': 0, 'R1-24': 0, 'R1-26': 0,
   'R2-18': 0, 'R2-20': 0, 'R2-22': 0, 'R2-24': 0, 'R2-26': 0}
\end{verbatim}
The corresponding {\ttfamily WBDC2hwif} command is 
{\ttfamily get\_pol\_sec\_states()}.

There is also a {\ttfamily set\_polarizers} command (redundant with
{\ttfamily set\_pol\_sec(state)}) where
{\ttfamily state} is True or False. 

For the conversion to work properly, the inputs to the quadrature hybrids
must be balanced.  The PIN diode attenuators can be controlled by specifying
a control voltage or an attenuation:
\begin{verbatim}
In [33]: wbdc.set_atten('R1-18-E', 3)
Out[33]: 3
In [34]: wbdc.get_atten('R1-18-E')
Out[34]: 3
In [35]: wbdc.get_atten_volts('R1-18-E')
Out[35]: array(-5.13863062061853)
In [36]: wbdc.set_atten_volts('R1-18-E', -3)\end{verbatim}
When you query and attenuation or voltage, you only get back what was sent to
the receiver in the previous command.  The hardware itself cannot be queried for
those data.

There is an equivalent command, {\ttfamily set\_atten\_volts(ID, attenID, volts)},
for {\ttfamily WBDC2hwif} but it is a little more clumsy.

\subsubsection{Down-converter (Mixer) Sections}

The state of the hybrid is 0 (False) to convert I/Q to L/U.  This is the
default state on power-up.  True means the hybrids are bypassed.
\begin{verbatim}
In [7]: wbdc.get_DC_states()
Out[7]:
  {'R1-18P1': 0, 'R1-18P2': 0, 'R1-20P1': 0, 'R1-20P2': 0, 'R1-22P1': 0,
   'R1-22P2': 0, 'R1-24P1': 0, 'R1-24P2': 0, 'R1-26P1': 0, 'R1-26P2': 0,
   'R2-18P1': 0, 'R2-18P2': 0, 'R2-20P1': 0, 'R2-20P2': 0, 'R2-22P1': 0,
   'R2-22P2': 0, 'R2-24P1': 0, 'R2-24P2': 0, 'R2-26P1': 0, 'R2-26P2': 0}
\end{verbatim}
This is a command implemented in {\ttfamily WBDC2hwif}.  The equivalent server
command is\linebreak {\ttfamily get\_IF\_hybrids()}.  The hybrids are all set

\subsubsection{Analog Monitor Data}

A label beginning with a number and ending with ``V'' or with ``V~ana'' or
``V~dig'' is a voltage reading.
A label beginning with a number and ending with anything else is a current
in A. A label ending in ``plate'' is a temperature in $^{\odot}$~Celsius.
The labels ending in ``plane'' will be detector readings when implemented.

\chapter{Un Soup\c{c}on de Python}\label{Python}

The DSN Radio Astronomy Monitor and Control system uses the object-oriented
features of Python.  Arguably, object-oriented program can be said to be based
on Plato's theory of forms.  Python objects are analogous to real objects
while classes correspond to forms or ideals, which are abstractions based on
real objects.

\section{iPython}

One can simply type {\tt python} at a shell prompt to get the standard Python
command line interface.  However, {\tt ipython} is preferable because it has
powerful extra features.  One that is used most often is {\it tab completion}
illustrated in Snippet~\ref{code:tab}.
\begin{code}[h!tb]
\begin{center}
\begin{verbatim}

In [2]: receiver
Out[2]: WBDC2 "WBDC-2"
In [3]: receiver.crossSwitch
Out[3]: TransferSwitch "WBDC transfer switch"

\caption[Creating a {\tt WBDC2} instance]{\label{code:tab}Example of creating a
{\tt WBDC2} instance and then
getting the classes corresponding to its {\tt crossSwitch} and
{\tt crossSwitch.Xswitch} attributes, and then a list of the latter's 
attributes and methods.}
\end{center}
\end{code}
This is very useful if you can't remember the name of an attribute or method.

One can also create an instance of a specific subsystem, as shown in
Snippet~\ref{code:attenuator}.
\begin{code}[h!tb]
\begin{center}
\begin{verbatim}

In [1]: from Electronics.Instruments.PINatten import PINattenuator

In [5]: vs = tdac['A']
In [8]: att = PINattenuator('R1-18-H', vs)
In [9]: att.<Tab>

\end{code}

\section{Classes}

A class is a natural way 
of describing a real-world object which has properties ({\it attributes}) and can
do things ({\it methods} or functions). 
The most basic class in the M\&C system is {\tt Device} which has the attributes 
{\tt name}, {\tt inputs} and {\tt outputs}, which are instance of {\tt Port}
classes, and {\tt data} about the device, such as the location of a telescope
or the bandwidth of a receiver.  Most classes discused here are sub-classes of 
{\tt Device}, which means that they ``inherit'' these attributes.

In the hope that it is more enlightening than confusing, 
Snippet~\ref{code:classTelescope} (page~\pageref{code:classTelescope}) gives an
example of a class definition.
\begin{code}[h!tb]
\begin{center}
\begin{verbatim}
  
class Telescope(Device):
  def __init__(self, obs, dss=0, LO=None, active=True):
    name = "DSS-"+str(dss)
    Device.__init__(self, name)
    self.inputs = {obs.name:obs}
    self['longitude'], self['latitude'], self['elevation'], tz, name, diam = \
            get_geodetic_coords(dss=int(dss))
    self['geo-x'],self['geo-y'],self['geo-z'] = \
            get_cartesian_coordinates('DSS '+str(dss))
    self.outputs[self.name] = Port(self, self.name, signal=Beam(str(dss)))
    self.outputs[self.name].signal['dss'] = dss\end{verbatim}
\caption{\label{code:classTelescope}Stripped-down definition of the 
{\tt Telescope} class.}
\end{center}
\end{code}
The {\tt \_\_init\_\_()} method creates an instance of this 
class\footnote{Creating an object from a class is called {\it instantiation},
making an {\tt instance} of a class.}, which 
inherits attributes from the class {\tt Device}. The second line creates the 
object and the rest of the code assigns values to its attributes.

  \caption{\label{fig:insideWBDC1}Interior of WBDC1.}
\end{figure}

\section{WBDC2}\label{sec:WBDC2}

Figure~\ref{fig:insideWBDC2} shows the interior of WBDC2. Mounted in the
DSS-43 R\&D cone the side at the bottom of the photograph will be at the top,
with the lid hanging down when open.

The motherboard is  on the lid.   The RF enters through four SMA bulkhead 
feed-throughs on the left.  The IFs exit on the right.
\begin{figure}[h!tb]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[height=6in]{interior-half.png}
  \end{center}
  \caption{\label{fig:insideWBDC2}Interior of WBDC2.}
\end{figure}
The crossover switches are the two modules in the
center to the far left in Figure~\ref{fig:insideWBDC2}.
The RF splitters which feed the bandpass filters (row of modules 
to the left of center) are the
larger blue modules at the top and bottom on the far left. 
The PIN diodes ahead of the polarization sections are under the black cables 
and DB9 connectors.
The quadrature hybrids for polarization mode conversion are to the right of the
black DB9 connectors.

Figure~\ref{fig:downconv} shows the twenty down-converter sections, each of
which has two outputs.
\begin{figure}[h!tb]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=6in]{WBDC2downconv.jpg}
    \caption[Down-converters in WBDC2]{\label{fig:downconv}Down-converters in

    refer to LG{\tt x} pin A{\it y} in DM~2 as discussed in 
    section~\ref{sec:DM2}.(Photo by L. Teitelbaum)}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The outputs and their labels are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:WBDCout}.
\begin{figure}[h!tb]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=6in]{WBDC2_outputs.png}
    \caption[WBDC2 outputs]{\label{fig:WBDCout}Outputs of WBDC2.}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
The polarizations are labeled ``H'' and ``E'' which refers to the native 
polarization of the orthomode outputs.  These are the polarizations of the
outputs if the polarization hybrids are bypassed.  Since the polarizations
could also be ``L'' and ``R'', the labels ``P1'' and ``P2'' are also used
in other contexts.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|cc|}
\hline
hybrid state: & 0 & 1 \\
\hline
P1            & E & L \\
P2            & H & R \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
  \begin{tabular}{|c|cc|}
    \hline
hybrid state: & 1 & 0 \\
\hline
IF1            & I & U \\
IF2            & Q & L \\
\hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
The ports are also labeled
``Q/L'' and ``I/U'' which refers to the types of IF which depend on the states
of the down-converter quadrature hybrids. Since the IF type depends on the state
of the down-converter hybrids, the terms ``IF1'' and ``IF2'' also also used.
Note that the logic is intentionally inverted so that the default state is
L/U, that is, the signals go through the hybrids.

These outputs are routed to an IF distribution panel shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:WBDCpatch}.
\begin{figure}[h!tb]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=6in]{WBDC_output_signals.jpg}
    \caption[WBDC2 output patch panel]{\label{fig:WBDCpatch}WBDC2 IF patch

    40 outputs can be routed via optic fibers to the control room.}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
This panel uses the P1/2 and IF1/2 notation.

This controls the LJTickDAC\textsuperscript{\textregistered} voltage sources.
All EIO and CIO ports are assigned to controlling this function and so are
digital outputs.

\chapter{Polarization Conversion}\label{app:pol}

\section{IAU Definition of Circular Polarization}

As reported in the Proceedings of the Fifteenth General Assembly \cite{IAU1974},
the following resolution was adopted by IAU Commissions 25 (Stellar Photometry
and Polarimetry) and 40 (Radio Astronomy):

{\itshape RESOLVED, that the frame of reference for the Stokes parameters is
that of Right Ascension and Declination with the position angle of the
electric-vector maximum, $\theta$, starting from North and increasing through
East. Elliptical polarization is defined in conformity with the definitions of
the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
(IEEE Standard 211)}\cite{IEEE1969}.

{\bfseries Left-Handed (Counterclockwise) Polarized Wave} (LCP):
An elliptically polarized electromagnetic wave in which the
rotation of the electric field vector with time is
counterclockwise for a stationary observer looking in the
direction of the wave normal.

{\bfseries Right-Handed (Clockwise) Polarized Wave} (RCP): 
An elliptically polarized electromagnetic wave in which the
rotation of the electric field vector with time is clockwise
for a stationary observer looking in the direction of the wave
normal.

This means that the polarization of incoming radiation for which the position
angle of the electric vector measured at a fixed point in space
increases with time is described as right-handed and positive.
\begin{figure}[h!tb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4in]{circular.png}
\caption[Circular Polarization]
{\label{fig:circ_pol} A right circularly polarized wave (LCP - green) and left
circularly polarized wave (RCP - red)
as defined by the IAU are shown decomposed into two
orthogonal linearly polarized waves (X - magenta, Y - blue). The thick arrows
show the direction of propagation.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
This can be seen in the lower panel of Figure~\ref{fig:circ_pol}\footnote{To 
view these images relax the eye muscles as if
looking at a distant object. A person not experienced in this
type of viewing might first look at a distant object and then
slide the gaze down to the figure without refocusing. Another
method is to place a sheet of cardboard with one edge down the
middle of the figure and the other edge between the eyes. It is
probably easier to focus first on a label above or below
the spiral, and then slide the gaze downwards.}

\section{Changing Between Linear and Circular
Polarization}\label{sec:lin-circ}

Figure~\ref{fig:circ_pol} shows that linear polarization can be converted to 
circular polarization.  If the vertical (H-plane or Y-axis) wave lags
behind the horizontal (E-plane or X-axis) wave by $90^{\circ}$ of
phase delay the resulting polarization will be RCP.
If the vertical (H-plane or Y-axis) wave leads
the horizontal (E-plane or X-axis) wave by $90^{\circ}$ of
phase delay the resulting polarization will be LCP.

Optically, this can be accomplished
by passing the beam through a particular thickness of material which
has different indices of refraction for two orthogonally polarized
components. Similarly, a waveguide section can be produced to perform the
same function.

\begin{figure}[h!tb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{quad_hybrid.eps}
\caption[Quadrature hybrid]{\label{fig:quad-hybrid}A quadrature hybrid
combines two input signals so that one is delayed $90^{\circ}$
with respect to the other. There are two outputs which are
symmetrically delayed.  The figure on the left shows a
conventional schematic.  The one on the right is a more
illustrative schematic.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
In the cm, mm, and submm wave domains, there exist devices which can
separate a radio wave into two orthogonally polarized components.
A quadrature hybrid can convert between the two modes, as shown in
Figure \ref{fig:quad-hybrid}. If port A were receiving
vertical polarization (H-plane or Y-axis) and B horizontal polarization 
(E-plane or X-axis) then at the port labelled A+$\angle 90^{\circ}$B, the
vertical polarization lags behind the horizontal and it would put out RCP.
The port labelled B+$\angle 90^{\circ}$A would put out LCP.

From this one can see that, if there is an option to bypass the hybrid, it 
depends which way the hybrid is put in the 
circuit which determines whether the output ports are E/L and H/R or are
E/R and H/L.

\chapter{Sideband Separation}

If the LO is in the middle of the RF band, then the mixing products will have
both positive frequencies from the upper sideband and negative frequencies from
the lower sideband. Both are present in the IF.  A complex mixer puts out
two IFs which are separated 90$^{\circ}$ in phase.  These two IFs can be
considered the real and imaginary parts of a complex signal. The upper and
lower sidebands can be recovered from a complex signal.

The outputs from a complex mixer can be phased together to separate
the upper and lower sidebands.  This is done with a $90^{\circ}$ hybrid,
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:quad-hybrid},
which re-combines the two quadrature phase mixing products.
To see this, consider the outputs of the two mixers to be the sum of
the USB and the LSB part of the down-converted spectrum with the
frequencies explicitly positive and negative,
{\itshape i.e.},
\begin{eqnarray}
V_R &=&   \frac{V_{U}}{\sqrt{2}} \cos( \omega_{U} t + \Delta \phi_{U})
        + \frac{V_{L}}{\sqrt{2}} \cos(-\omega_{L} t + \Delta \phi_{L}),
          \label{eq:V_real-1} \\
    &=&   \frac{V_{U}}{\sqrt{2}} \cos(\omega_{U} t + \Delta \phi_{U})
        + \frac{V_{L}}{\sqrt{2}} \cos(\omega_{L} t - \Delta \phi_{L}),
          \label{eq:V_real-2} \\
V_I &=&   \frac{V_{U}}{\sqrt{2}} \sin( \omega_{U} t + \Delta \phi_{U})
        + \frac{V_{L}}{\sqrt{2}} \sin(-\omega_{L} t + \Delta \phi_{L}),
          \label{eq:V_imag-1} \\
    &=&   \frac{V_{U}}{\sqrt{2}} \sin(\omega_{U} t + \Delta \phi_{U})
        - \frac{V_{L}}{\sqrt{2}} \sin(\omega_{L} t - \Delta \phi_{L})
      \label{eq:V_imag-2}
\end{eqnarray}
where $U$ refers to the upper sideband and $L$ the lower sideband.
Then if these signals are combined in a quadrature hybrid, the effect
along the paths with the $\pi/2$ delay is that the delayed signal at
the summation point is that which entered the delay section $t - \pi/2\omega$
earlier.  This means that we subtract $\pi/2$ from the angular terms in 
Equations~\ref{eq:V_real-1} and~\ref{eq:V_imag-1} as illustrated
in Figure~\ref{fig:phase-delay}.
\begin{figure}[h!tb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=5in]{hybrid-delay.png}
\caption[Phase delay]{\label{fig:phase-delay}The angular term for the green line
in the lower panel is $\pi/2$ smaller than in the upper panel, showing that the
effect is to delay the signal. (The dotted
lines show a slighly earlier time for a positive frequency signal; so
the signal moves left with time.)}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Subtracting $\pi/2$ from the angular terms is equivalent to 
subtracting $\pi/2$ from the phases associated with the positive 
frequency terms and adding $\pi/2$ to the phases associated with the 
negative frequency terms in Equations~\ref{eq:V_real-2} and~\ref{eq:V_imag-2}.
The outputs from the hybrid will then be
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{V_R}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{V_I \angle 90^{\circ}}{\sqrt{2}} \label{eq:sum_usb}
&=&
   \frac{V_{U}}{\sqrt{2}} \cos(\omega_{U} t + \phi_{U})
 + \frac{V_{L}}{\sqrt{2}} \cos(\omega_{L} t - \phi_{L}) \nonumber \\
& &
  + \frac{V_{U}}{\sqrt{2}} \sin(\omega_{U} t + \phi_{U} - \frac{\pi}{2})
  - \frac{V_{L}}{\sqrt{2}} \sin(\omega_{L} t - \phi_{L} - \frac{\pi}{2})
     \nonumber \\
&=&
\;\;  \frac{V_{U}}{\sqrt{2}} \cos(\omega_{U} t + \phi_{U})
    + \frac{V_{L}}{\sqrt{2}} \cos(\omega_{L} t - \phi_{L})
\nonumber \\
& & - \frac{V_{U}}{\sqrt{2}} \cos(\omega_{U} t + \phi_{U})
    + \frac{V_{L}}{\sqrt{2}} \cos(\omega_{L} t - \phi_{L})
\nonumber \\
&=& \;\;   \sqrt{2}V_{L} \cos(\omega_{L} t + \phi_{L}) \label{eq:nu_usb}\\
\frac{V_R \angle 90^{\circ}}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{V_I}{\sqrt{2}} \label{eq:sum_lsb}
&=&
   \frac{V_{U}}{\sqrt{2}} \cos(\omega_{U} t + \phi_{U} - \frac{\pi}{2})
 + \frac{V_{L}}{\sqrt{2}} \cos(\omega_{L} t - \phi_{L} - \frac{\pi}{2}) \nonumber \\
& &
 + \frac{V_{U}}{\sqrt{2}} \sin(\omega_{U} t + \phi_{U})

  \frac{V_{U}}{\sqrt{2}} \sin(\omega_{U} t + \phi_{U})
 + \frac{V_{L}}{\sqrt{2}} \sin(\omega_{U} t - \phi_{L})
\nonumber \\
& &    + \frac{V_{U}}{\sqrt{2}} \sin(\omega_{U} t + \phi_{U})
       - \frac{V_{L}}{\sqrt{2}} \sin(\omega_{U} t - \phi_{L})

&=& \!    \sqrt{2}V_{U} \sin(\omega_{U} t + \phi_{U})
\end{eqnarray}
Note that adding $\pi/2$ to the image band terms in
Equations~\ref{eq:V_real-1} and~\ref{eq:V_imag-1} is like subtracting
$\pi/2$ from the image band terms in
Equations~\ref{eq:V_real-2} and~\ref{eq:V_imag-2},
{\itshape i.e.} the sign of the $\pi/2$ added is the same as the sign
of the frequency.

The time-averaged power in each band is
\begin{eqnarray}
P_{USB} &=& V^2_{USB} \nonumber \\
        &=& 2 V^2_{U}
\left \langle\cos^2(\omega_{IF} t + \phi_{U}) \right \rangle
\nonumber \\
        &=& V^2_{U} \label{eq:usb_power}\\
P_{LSB} &=& V^2_{L} \label{eq:lsb_power}
\end{eqnarray}
Equations \ref{eq:usb_power} and \ref{eq:lsb_power},
when added together, give the power in both sidebands.
